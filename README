./catalogues/
	Scripts for scraping heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov for tables of archived Chandra/XMM/ROSAT observation data
	- filters the Galactic plane

./fastcluster/
	Daniel MÃ¼llner's fast (ie, O(n^2)) agglomerative clustering algorithm for python/R
	- http://math.stanford.edu/~muellner/fastcluster.html

chronicle_galaxy_clusters.sh
	To be called on a master-cluster directory outputted from find_clusters.py
	- greps through *.tsv files produced from agglomerative clustering, searching for the keyphrase 'Cluster of Galaxies', counts the number of observations whenever theres a hit
	- Outputs to ./master-cluster/galaxy_clusters.txt

find_clusters.py
	A python script/module for cataloging clusters in a tsv 
		* needs master.tsv generated from catalogues
	- Generates ./master-cluster/ directory

get_XMM_obs_url.py
	Goes to xsa.esac.esa.int website containing XMM archive data and requests an ObsID, printing to output the FTP site that XSA says to go to when you do that

get_XMM_obs.sh
	Calls wget on output of get_XMM_obs_url.py, if any

make_catalogue.py
	Wrapper script that calls routines in find_clusters.py and plot_clusters.py

make_makefiles.sh
	Populates ./master-cluster/ directory with Makefiles for each subdirectory

plot_clusters.py
	A python script/module for doing a Mollweide projection of clustered observations onto the sky
