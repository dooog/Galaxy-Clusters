The prospects for a purely substitutional theory of quantification are thus no worse than for a referential account.},

It is found that in a scale-dependent way, the Shannon information in complete genomes are much greater than that in matching random sequences--thousands of times greater in the case of short words. Furthermore, with the exception of the 14 chromosomes of Plasmodium falciparum, the Shannon information in all available complete genomes belong to a universality class given by an extremely simple formula. The data are consistent with a model for genome growth composed of two main ingredients: random segmental duplications that increase the Shannon information in a scale-independent way, and random point mutations that preferentially reduces the larger-scale Shannon information. The inference drawn from the present study is that the large-scale and coarse-grained growth of genomes was selectively neutral and this suggests an independent corroboration of Kimura's neutral theory of evolution.},

logics to a probabilistic setting, obtaining a calculus for multi-agent update with three natural slots: prior probability
on states, occurrence probabilities in the relevant process taking place, and observation probabilities of events. To match
this update mechanism, we present a complete dynamic logic of information change with a probabilistic character. The completeness
proof follows a compositional methodology that applies to a much larger class of dynamic-probabilistic logics as well. Finally,
we discuss how our basic update rule can be parameterized for different update policies, or learning methods.},

A very robust and fully autonomous design for {IAA} can be fulfilled by the use of a simple magnetic control law, a proportional-plus-derivative controller. A modified {"B-dot} law" provides the derivative control action while the cross product of spacecraft {+Z} body axis vector and geomagnetic field vector provides the proportional control action. Attitude motion of the spacecraft is reduced by forcing the spacecraft's {+Z} body axis to align with the Earth's magnetic field vector. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the design. When the initial deviation is not large, the attitude convergence can be completed in one orbit.},

	abstract = {The High Energy Explorer Satellite 2 {(HETE-2)} mission has been highly productive. It has observed more than 250 γ-ray bursts {(GRBs)} so far. It is currently localizing 25–30 {GRBs} per year, and has localized 43 {GRBs} to date. Twenty-one of these localizations have led to the detection of X-ray, optical, or radio afterglows, and as of now, 11 of the bursts with afterglows have redshift determinations. {HETE-2} has also observed more than 45 bursts from soft γ-ray repeaters, and more than 700 X-ray bursts.

{HETE-2} has confirmed the connection between {GRBs} and Type Ic supernovae, a singular achievement and certainly one of the scientific highlights of the mission so far. It has provided evidence that the isotropic-equivalent energies and luminosities of {GRBs} may be correlated with redshift; such a correlation would imply that {GRBs} and their progenitors evolve strongly with redshift. Both of these results have profound implications for the nature of {GRB} progenitors and for the use of {GRBs} as a probe of cosmology and the early universe.

{HETE-2} has placed severe constraints on any X-ray or optical afterglow of a short {GRB.} It has made it possible to explore the previously unknown behavior of optical afterglows at very early times, and has opened up the era of high-resolution spectroscopy of {GRB} optical afterglows. It is also solving the mystery of “optically dark” {GRBs}, and revealing the nature of X-ray flashes.},

Natural extensions exist to cover correlation without rotation, or serial correlation. For testing for correlation, distributional results are given for p = 2 and 3, and especially for uniform parent populations.},

	abstract = {Much of our everyday knowledge is risky. This not only includes personal judgments, but the results of measurement, data obtained from references or by report, the results of statistical testing, etc. There are two (often opposed) views in {AI} on how to handle risky empirical knowledge. One view, characterized often by modal or nonmonotonic logics, is that the structure of such knowledge should be captured by the formal logical properties of a set of sentences, if we can just get the logic right. The other view takes probability to be central to the characterization of risky knowledge, but often does not allow for the tentative or corrigible acceptance of a set of sentences. We examine a view, based on [epsilon]-acceptability that combines both probability and modality. A statement is [epsilon]-accepted if the probability of its denial is at most [epsilon], where [epsilon] is taken to be a fixed small parameter as is customary in the practice of statistical testing. We show that given a body of evidence {[Gamma][delta]}, the set of [epsilon]-accepted statements {[Gamma][epsilon]} has exactly the logical structure of a classical modal system {EMN}, the smallest classical modal logic E supplemented by the schemata M: [square, open][epsilon]([upper left corner] [phi] [logical and] [psi] [upper right corner]) --{\textgreater} ([square, open][epsilon] [phi] [logical and] [square, open][epsilon] [psi]) and N: [square, open][epsilon][inverted perpendicular].},

We also consider a related notion, that of safe belief, which is a weak (non-negatively introspective) type of “knowledge”. We develop a probabilistic version of this concept (“degree
of safety”) and we analyze its role in games. We completely axiomatize the logic of conditional belief, knowledge and safe
belief over conditional probabilistic models. We develop a theory of probabilistic dynamic belief revision, introducing probabilistic
“action models” and proposing a notion of probabilistic update product, that comes together with appropriate reduction laws.},

Most of the cases, this logic is not Classical {(Boolean).} The general logic for the Topoi is Intuitionistic Higher-order Logic. Topoi have their linguistic counter-part provided by Local Set Theories {(LST).} There is a deductive apparatus, in the style of Sequent Calculus, able to justify logical consequence inside any {LST.} Counterfactuals are subtle conditionals largely studied by the philosophical and logic community. Since Lewis, counterfactual have a uniform semantics provided by means of Neighborhood systems on top a possible world style semantics. In this article, taking into account the fundamental theorem on Topoi, we define, by means of the internal logic of Graphs, Lewis counterfactuals and show how to use the {LST} deductive apparatus to prove properties on counterfactual logic.

We take a broad view of the Bayesian approach as dictating inter alia that from the perspective of a given logic, rational degrees of belief are those representable by probability functions from the class appropriate to that logic. Classical Bayesianism, which fixes the logic as classical logic, is only one version of this general approach. Another, which we call Intuitionistic Bayesianism, selects intuitionistic logic as the preferred logic and the associated class of probability functions as the right class of candidate representions of epistemic states (rational allocations of degrees of belief). Various objections to classical Bayesianism are, we argue, best met by passing to intuitionistic Bayesianism—in which the probability functions are taken relative to intuitionistic logic—rather than by adopting a radically {non-Kolmogorovian}, for example, nonadditive, conception of (or substitute for) probability functions, in spite of the popularity of the latter response among those who have raised these objections. The interest of intuitionistic Bayesianism is further enhanced by the availability of a Dutch Book argument justifying the selection of intuitionistic probability functions as guides to rational betting behavior when due consideration is paid to the fact that bets are settled only when/if the outcome bet on becomes known.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1111},
	abstract = {The recent transient event Swift J1644+57 has been interpreted as emission from a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset of accretion onto a supermassive black hole following the tidal disruption of a star. Here we model the radio-microwave emission as synchrotron radiation produced by the shock interaction between the jet and the gaseous circumnuclear medium {(CNM).} At early times after the onset of the jet (t {\textless} 5-10 days) a reverse shock propagates through and decelerates the ejecta, while at later times the outflow approaches the {Blandford-McKee} self-similar evolution (possibly modified by additional late energy injection). The achromatic break in the radio light curve of J1644+57 is naturally explained as the transition between these phases. We show that the temporal indices of the pre- and post-break light curve are consistent with those predicted if the {CNM} has a wind-type radial density profile n {\textasciitilde} 1/r{\textasciicircum}2. The observed synchrotron frequencies and self-absorbed flux constrain the fraction of the post-shock thermal energy in relativistic electrons epsilon\_e {\textasciitilde} 0.03-0.1; the {CNM} density at 1e18 cm {\textasciitilde} 1-10 1/cm{\textasciicircum}3; and the initial Lorentz factor Gamma\_j {\textasciitilde} 10-20 and opening angle theta\_j {\textasciitilde} {(0.1-1)Gamma\_j{\textasciicircum}(-1)} {\textasciitilde} 0.01-0.1 of the jet. Radio modeling thus provides robust independent evidence for a narrowly collimated outflow. Extending our model to the future evolution of J1644+57, we predict that the radio flux at low frequencies ({\textless}{\textasciitilde} few {GHz)} will begin to brighten more rapidly once the characteristic frequency crosses below the self-absorption frequency on a timescale of months (indeed, such a transition may already have begun). Our results demonstrate that relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events provide a unique probe of the conditions in distant, previously inactive galactic nuclei, complementing studies of normal {AGN.}},

	abstract = {Luminous X-ray outbursts with variability amplitudes as high as {\textasciitilde}1000 have been detected from a small number of galactic nuclei. These events are likely associated with transient fueling of nuclear supermassive black holes. In this paper we constrain X-ray outbursts with harder spectra, higher redshifts, and lower luminosities than have been studied previously. We performed a systematic survey of 24,668 optical galaxies in the Chandra Deep Fields to search for such X-ray outbursts; the median redshift of these galaxies is {\textasciitilde}0.8. The survey spans 798 days for the Chandra Deep {Field-North}, and 1828 days for the Chandra Deep {Field-South.} No outbursts were found, and thus we set upper limits on the rate of such events in the universe, which depend on the adopted outburst X-ray luminosity. For an outburst with X-ray luminosity {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1043 ergs s-1 and a duration of 6 months, the upper limit on its event rate is {\textasciitilde}10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. Compared to previous survey results, our harder band and deeper survey suggests that the outburst rate may increase by a maximum factor of 10 when considering both obscured X-ray outbursts and redshift evolution from z{\textasciitilde}0 to z{\textasciitilde}0.8. Our results also suggest that the X-ray luminosity function for moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei is not primarily due to stellar tidal disruptions.},

	abstract = {Connections and equivalences among the diffusion, mobility fluctuation, and island theories of the flicker noise are shown, and the usual division in two model categories, based on the carrier-number and -mobility fluctuations, is so removed. To this end, the diffusion-noise theory, as well as the previous island model, is applied to conducting media containing localized states, the drift-velocity cross-correlation functions of the hemimicroscopic motion of each carrier, which at random is trapped and released by the islands, are computed, and, finally, the voltage noise spectrum at the device terminals is achieved as a sum of Lorentzian spectra by means of the {Wiener-Khintchine} theorem and the impedance-field method. It partly coincides with the one yielded, in the case of defect sizes smaller than the Debye length, by the island model through the charge-conservation principle, the Langevin method, the Schottky theorem, and the dipole-current and impedance-field methods applied directly to each island. For both approaches, in order to obtain the total noise spectrum in the flickerlike form 1/fγ, the defect relaxation times, which the diffusion theory cannot yield, and the computation methods of the island model are to be employed. The diffusion-noise model, instead, by the computation of the cross-correlation functions of the hemimicroscopic motion allows one to ascribe the flicker-noise origin also to the hemimicroscopic mobility fluctuation of each carrier due just to the stochastic process of its trapping and releasing by the islands during the drift displacement. Therefore the general validity of the island model, previously shown by its ability to yield an unitary synthesis of the flicker, burst, and generation-recombination noises, is now further extended and strengthened by its capability to account for and to contain other noise-analysis methods, such as the diffusion-noise and mobility-fluctuation models.},

Unbundled data strategy incorporating bit encoding and return to zero schemes was adopted for {FPGA-compliant} micropipeline instead of bundled data strategy in full-custom micropipeline. Handshaking protocol also had to be redefined for this novel micropipeline.

The introduced delay element was implemented with a special technology independent circuit called single inverter ring oscillator {(SIRO).} In order to verify the adaptive nature of {SIRO} circuit, its behavior as an on-chip oscillator driving co-existing synchronous circuits was also studied. Implementation of externally clock less {RISC} in {FPGA}, exhibiting optimal performance without power overhead and electromagnetic compatibility {(EMC)} is an effort in this direction.},

	abstract = {Programming Pythonfocuses on advanced uses of the Python programming/scripting language, which has evolved from an emerging language of interest primarily to pioneers, to a widely accepted tool that traditional programmers use for real day-to-day development tasks. With Python, you can do almost anything you can do with C++; but Python is an interpreted language designed for rapid application development and deployment. Among other things, Python supports object-oriented programming; a remarkably simple, readable, and maintainable syntax; integration with C components; and a vast collection of pre-coded interfaces and utilities. As Python has grown to embrace developers on a number of different platforms {(Unix}, Linux, Windows, Mac), companies have taken notice and are adopting Python for their products. It has shown up animating the latest Star Wars movie, serving up maps and directories on the Internet, guiding users through Linux installations, testing chips and boards, managing Internet discussion forums, scripting online games, and even scripting wireless products. Programming Pythonis the most comprehensive resource for advanced Python programmers available today. Reviewed and endorsed by Python creator Guido van Rossum, who also provides the foreword, this book zeroes in on real-world Python applications. It's been updated for Python 2.0 and covers Internet scripting, systems programming, Tkinter {GUIs}, C integration domains, and new Python tools and applications. Among them: {IDLE}, {JYthon}, Active Scripting and {COM} extensions, Zope, {PSP} server pages, restricted execution mode, the {HTMLgen} and {SWIG} code generators, thread support, {CGI} and Internet protocol modules. Such applications are the heart and soul of this second edition. Veteran {O'Reilly} author Mark Lutz has included a platform-neutral {CD-ROM} with book examples and various Python-related packages, including the full Python 2.0 source code distribution.},

This logic uses typed combinators, and we give a more or less direct translation into typed \&lgr;-calculus, which is an easier formalism to use, though not so easy for the metatheory because of the presence of bound variables. We then describe, by example only, a proof-checker program which has been implemented for this logic; the program is fully described in [2]. We relate the induction rule which is central to the logic to two more familiar rules - Recursion Induction and Structural Induction - showing that the former is a theorem of the logic, and that for recursively defined structures the latter is a derived rule of the logic. Finally we show how the syntax and semantics of a simple programming language may be described completely in the logic, and we give an example of a theorem which relates syntactic and semantic properties of programs and which can be stated and proved within the logic.},

There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 with a smaller-scale blazar.},

Here we consider an approach that is more common in the economics literature, which works purely at the semantic, set\&dash;theoretic level. We provide set\&dash;theoretic completeness results for a number of epistemic and conditional logics, and contrast the expressive power of the syntactic and set\&dash;theoretic approaches.},

How to analyse communications to subgroups of the public, and the effects of such common knowledge of a subgroup on the information state of a larger group, has only recently come into fruition. Knowledge games are introduced to provide a comfortably concrete vehicle for the study of such interactions. This paper introduces the concepts of knowledge game, deal of cards, knowledge game state, game action, and action execution. A deal of cards is a function from cards to players. A knowledge game state is represented by a pointed multiagent S5 model on the set of card deals where all players hold the same number of cards as in the actual deal. A game action combines a question with an answer, and is represented by a pointed multiagent S5 frame on the set of possible answers. The execution of a game action in a knowledge game state corresponds to the computation of a pointed multiagent S5 model that is a restriction of the direct product of the corresponding action frame and game model.},

Classical, intuitionistic, quantum and non-modal linear logics, are all obtained as extensions in a uniform way and in a single framework. We isolate three properties, which characterize B positively: reflection, symmetry and visibility. A logical constant obeys to the principle of reflection if it is characterized semantically by an equation binding it with a metalinguistic link between assertions, and if its syntactic inference rules are obtained by solving that equation. All connectives of basic logic satisfy reflection. To the control of weakening and contraction of linear logic, basic logic adds a strict control of contexts, by requiring that all active formulae in all rules are isolated, that is visible. From visibility, cut-elimination follows. The full, geometric symmetry of basic logic induces known symmetries of its extensions, and adds a symmetry among them, producing the structure of a cube.},

	abstract = {Neighbourhood structures are the standard semantic tool used to reason about non-normal modal logics. In coalgebraic terms, a neighbourhood frame is a coalgebra for the contravariant powerset functor composed with itself, denoted by 22. In our paper, we investigate the coalgebraic equivalence notions of 22-bisimulation, behavioural equivalence and neighbourhood bisimulation (a notion based on pushouts), with the aim of finding the logically correct notion of equivalence on neighbourhood structures. Our results include relational characterisations for 22-bisimulation and neighbourhood bisimulation, and an analogue of Van Benthem's characterisation theorem for all three equivalence notions. We also show that behavioural equivalence gives rise to a {Hennessy-Milner} theorem, and that this is not the case for the other two equivalence notions.},

Active period durations with physical activity count successively above a predefined threshold, when rescaled with individual means, follow a universal stretched exponential (gamma-type) cumulative distribution with characteristic time, both in healthy individuals and in patients with major depressive disorder. On the other hand, resting period durations below the threshold for both groups obey a scale-free power-law cumulative distribution over two decades, with significantly lower scaling exponents in the patients. We thus find universal distribution laws governing human behavioral organization, with a parameter altered in depression.},

	abstract = {Anecdotal evidence points to the use of beauty as an indication of truth in mathematical problem solving. In the two experiments of the present study, we examined the use of heuristics and tested the assumption that participants use symmetry as a cue for correctness in an arithmetic verification task. We manipulated the symmetry of sets of dot pattern addition equations. Speeded decisions about the correctness of these equations led to higher endorsements for both correct and incorrect equations when the addend and sum dot patterns were symmetrical. Therefore, this effect is not due to the fact that symmetry facilitates calculation or estimation. We found systematic evidence for the use of heuristics in solving mathematical tasks, and we discuss how these findings relate to a processing-fluency account of intuition in mathematical judgment.},

In contrast to its predecessors and most other implementations, {Isabelle/HOL} datatypes may be mutually and indirect recursive,
even infinitely branching. We also support inverted datatype definitions for characterizing existing types as being inductive
ones later. All our constructions are fully definitional according to established {HOL} tradition. Stepping back from the logical
details, we also see this work as a typical example of what could be called {“Formal-Logic} Engineering”. We observe that building
realistic theorem proving environments involves further issues rather than pure logic only.},

The problem arises in the reconstruction of the motion of a rigid body on the surface of the sphere. The comparable model for \$p\$-dimensional Euclidean space data is that \$({\textbackslash}nu\_1, {\textbackslash}ldots, {\textbackslash}nu\_n)\$ are independent with \${\textbackslash}nu\_i\$ symmetrically distributed around \${\textbackslash}gamma A {\textbackslash}cdot u\_i + b, u\_i\$ known, where the real constant \${\textbackslash}gamma {\textgreater} 0, p {\textbackslash}times p\$ rotation matrix {\$A\$} and \$p\$-vector \$b\$ are the parameters to be estimated. This paper also calculates the influence functions and asymptotic distributions of {\$M\$-estimators} for \${\textbackslash}gamma, A\$ and \$b\$. Besides rigid body motion, this problem arises in image registration from landmark data. Particular attention is paid to how the geometry of the rigid body or landmarks affects the statistical properties of the estimators.},

	abstract = {Large-amplitude, high-luminosity soft X-ray flares were detected by the {ROSAT} {All-Sky} Survey in several galaxies with no evidence of Seyfert activity in their ground-based optical spectra. These flares had the properties predicted for a tidal disruption of a star by a central supermassive black hole. We report Chandra observations of three of these galaxies taken a decade after their flares that reveal weak nuclear X-ray sources that are from 240 to 6000 times fainter than their luminosities at peak, supporting the theory that these were special events and not ongoing active galactic nucleus {(AGN)} variability. The decline of {RX} J1624.9+7554 by a factor of 6000 is consistent with the {(t-tD)-5/3} decay predicted for the fallback phase of a tidal disruption event, but only if {ROSAT} was lucky enough to catch the event exactly at its peak in 1990 October. {RX} {J1242.6-1119A} has declined by a factor of 240, also consistent with {(t-tD)-5/3.} In the H {II} galaxy {NGC} 5905 we find only resolved, soft X-ray emission that is undoubtedly associated with starburst activity. When accounting for the starburst component, the {ROSAT} observations of {NGC} 5905, as well as the Chandra upper limit on its nuclear flux, are consistent with a {(t-tD)-5/3} decay by at least a factor of 1000. Although we found weak Seyfert 2 emission lines in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of {NGC} 5905, indicating that a low-luminosity {AGN} was present prior to the X-ray flare, we favor a tidal disruption explanation for the flare itself.},

We investigate such systems. In the first part of the paper knowledge and belief, without time, are considered. Common knowledge and common belief are defined and compared. A logical system and a family of models are proposed, a completeness result is proved and a decision procedure described. In the second part of the paper, time is considered. Different notions of beliefs are distinguished, obeying different properties of persistence. One interpretation of belief which obeys a very strong persistence axiom is put forward and used in the analysis of "wise men" puzzle.},

Two models are presented: the spherical regression model, that deals with a highly idealized form of the data, and a more realistic analysis for the types of data used in plate reconstructions. The discussion of the spherical regression model focuses on the interplay of the geometry of the plate boundaries and the statistical properties of a least square estimator. Because the errors in tectonic data are extremely concentrated, the more realistic analysis reduces to a linear regression. Once this is realized, many problems of geophysical interest, such as triple junctions can be handled. The paper closes with a selection of possible problems for further consideration. /// Cet article discute certains aspects statistiques des rotations estimées, en particulier celles concernant les reconstructions paléogéographiques dans le cadre de la tectonique des plaques. Deux modèles sont présentés: un modèle de régression sphérique, à partir d'une forme très idéale des données, et une analyse plus réaliste tenant compte des données utilisées pour les reconstructions. Le modèle de régression sphérique décrit plus particulièrement les relations entre la géométrie des frontières des plaques reconstruites et les propriétés statistiques d'un critère d'estimation par moindres carrés de leur assemblage. Les erreurs sur les données observées étant extrêmement concentrées, l'analyse réaliste se réduit à une régression linéaire. Cette étape réalisée, la résolution d'autres problèmes d'intérêt géophysique, tels la fermeture d'une jonction triple, peut être envisagée.

	abstract = {A geometrical method to assess the quality of a part is to sample points on the surface of the part and to bring an ideal computer representation of the part as close as possible to the sampled locations. The points are sampled with a coordinate measuring machine {(CMM)} that gives the coordinates, with respect to the machine's own three-dimensional system of axis, of the sampled locations. Computer-assisted design {(CAD)} gives the ideal representation of the part. The matching involves estimating a rotation and a translation vector characterizing the rigid body transformation needed to go from the computer model to the sampled locations. The sum of the squared residual distances between the sampled locations and the fitted computer part is a measure of the quality of the part. This article investigates the statistical properties of this method when the surface of the part is made of planar regions. Estimating the translation vector and the rotation matrix is shown to be "locally" equivalent to fitting a linear model to the localization data. Three components of the residual sum of squared distances are identified. They measure within planar region variability, the orientation conformity of the planar regions, and the size discrepancies of the regions. Diagnostics for linear models are adapted to yield statistical tests for specific geometric failures of a part. The developments use first-order asymptotic expansions of the estimators and of the sum of squared residuals for the local linear model, as the errors associated with the sampled locations go to 0.},

	abstract = {We investigate a peculiar intuitionistic modal logic, called Propositional Lax Logic {(PLL)}, which has promising applications to the formal verification of computer hardware. The logic has emerged from an attempt to express correctness up to behavioural constraints--a central notion in hardware verification--as a logical modality. As a modal logic it is special since it features a single modal operator [circle, open] that has a flavour both of possibility and of necessity. In the paper we provide the motivation for {PLL} and present several technical results. We investigate some of its proof-theoretic properties, presenting a cut-elimination theorem for a standard Gentzen-style sequent presentation of the logic. We go on to define a new class of fallible two-frame Kripke models for {PLL.} These models are unusual since they feature worlds with inconsistent information; furthermore, the only frame condition imposed is that the [circle, open]-frame be a subrelation of the [superset or implies]-frame. We give a natural translation of these models into Goldblatt's -space models of {PLL.} Our completeness theorem for these models yields a Gödel-style embedding of {PLL} into a classical bimodal theory of type {(S4}, S4) and underpins a simple proof of the finite model property. We proceed to prove soundness and completeness of several theories for specialized classes of models. We conclude with a brief exploration of two concrete and rather natural types of model from hardware verification for which the modality [circle, open] models correctness up to timing constraints. We obtain decidability of [circle, open]-free fragment of the logic of the first type of model, which coincides with the stable form of Maksimova's intermediate {logicL[Pi].}},
